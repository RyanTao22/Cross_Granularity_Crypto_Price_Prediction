# Cross_Granularity_Crypto_Price_Prediction

This repository is for team Gao-Qian-Tao's MAFM-6010z final project.

In this project, we validate the Contrastive Multi-Granularity Learning Framework's ability to predict price movements on minute-level cryptocurrency datasets. 
Qilb was used as the quantitative research framework as well as the data import methodology. Pytorch, Scared and Tensorboard  are used for machine learning research.
